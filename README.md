## Report

Project Overview
The Hotel Management System is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline the
management of hotel operations. Built with React on the frontend and Express.js on the backend,
this system provides an efficient and user-friendly interface for managing hotel data, including
restaurant details and menu items.

Frontend Features

1. State Management: Use Redux to manage the application's state, including restaurant data and
search term.
2. Action Creators and Reducers: Implement action creators (addRestaurant, deleteRestaurant,
updateRestaurant, searchRestaurant) and corresponding reducers to handle state changes.
3. Navigation: Use react-router-dom for navigation between different components (e.g., Restaurant
List, Add Restaurant).
4. Controlled Components: Manage form input values using state to control form elements.
5. Validation: Add validation rules for form inputs to ensure correct data entry.
6. Components:
 - RestaurantList: Display a paginated list of restaurants with search functionality.
 - EditRestaurant: Provide a form for editing restaurant details with input validation.
 - EditModal: Display a modal for editing restaurant details.
7. Styling: Use Tailwind CSS for styling components, providing a responsive and modern UI.
8. API Integration: Create utility functions (getData, postData) to interact with backend APIs.
9. Constants: Define constants for API endpoints (e.g., DELETE_DATA, GET_DATA,
UPDATE_DATA).
10. Pagination: Implement pagination to manage large datasets, displaying a limited number of

records per page.
11. Search Functionality: Implement search functionality to filter restaurants by name.
12. Image Uploading Feature: Allow users to upload images for restaurant entries.

Backend Features

1. Server Setup: Set up an Express.js server to handle API requests.
2. Routes: Define routes for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on restaurant data.
3. CRUD Operations:
 - Create: Implement API endpoints to add new restaurants.
 - Read: Implement API endpoints to retrieve restaurant data, including search and pagination.
 - Update: Implement API endpoints to update existing restaurant details.
 - Delete: Implement API endpoints to delete restaurants.
4. Middleware:
 - Error Handling: Implement middleware for error handling and validation.
 - Body Parsing: Use middleware to parse JSON request bodies.
5. Input Validation: Validate incoming data to ensure it meets the required criteria before processing.
6. Image Uploading Feature: Implement middleware for handling image uploads using Multer.
Ensure images are processed and stored correctly on the server
